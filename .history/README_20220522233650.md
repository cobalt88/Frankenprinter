 ## Overall Description 
 - - - 
 
This is not an entirely original work, this is simply my customized version of the open source Marlin 2.0.x Bugfix firmware that was used to build my Frankenprinter project. The Frankenprinter was once upon a time a Creality ender 3, and has since had so many pieces and parts replaced, reconfigured, grafted from other machines, and more often than not flat out custom designed and printed on other printer for this printer, that the Argo may be a more fitting name. However, this simple $250 (at the time) 3D printer with almost $1000 in upgrades and custom firmware, is now one of th most capable 3D printers I have, if all you print with is PLA. This has been a remarkably fun journey and one of these days I will make a full write up of all the fun and struggle I went through with this machine, but for now, this is the repository i am deticating to the stable version of Frankenprinters custom firmware.

 ## Installation Instructions
 - - -

no install required - unless you're really crazy enough to build one of these machines. 

 ## Instructions/How To Use
 - - -
 
 In a perfect world with a full walkthrough of everything i did to that poor machine, you would compile the firmware and load the firmware.bin file that results onto a micro sd card, load that card into the machine, and pray it works. This however is really not reccomended as i did not completely document all the changes i made to this machine and this firmware is really only intended for use by that specific machine. 

 ## Contribution Guidelines
 - - -
 If you would like to contribute to the project, feel free to do so. Some things to keep in mind:

 1. Please use structured/formatted commit messages that adhere to the following guideline: git commit -m "{the version you are working from, ie, 1.1.x}" -m "{detailed description of the changes}" -m "{this bit is optional but who it is and the date}"
 for now this is just a personal preference to keep the repository nice and tidy, eventually these guidelines will be updated to reflect whatever version nomenclature i decide to use. 

 2. Do Not open a pull request on the main branch, it will be denied. period. Start a new feature branch or open a pull request to develop so your contributions can be reviewed first. 

 3. Comment your code, since I didn't write your code i might not know right away what it does. Please keep your code clean, tidy, and well commented to make integration of features more seamless. 

 4. if you'd like to be a regular contributor reach out and ask to be a collaborator,
